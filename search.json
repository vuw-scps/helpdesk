All levels (100 to 400) are welcome – we’re hoping you’ll take the opportunity to help each other in groups, but we’ll also have some academics and grad students come along to help.\nTo get the ball rolling for the first session (Tuesday 7th March), there will be pizza and soft drinks at 12:15 pm.\nOnce a month, we’ll also organise a 20–30 minutes “teaser” presentation on some programming topics that you may wish to explore further*.\nThe Physics Team\n*: Tentative list of topics for 2023, in no particular order:\n\n10 common misconceptions about LaTeX\nR.I.P: On using R in Physics\nBibliography management with Zotero and Bibtex\nGrammar of Graphics\nComputational simulations with Julia\nReproducible analyses with Quarto\nInteractive apps with Shiny\nVersion control and collaboration with Github\nCreating a personal website in 10 minutes\n“glue” code"
