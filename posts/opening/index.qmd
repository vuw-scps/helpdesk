[![Aims of the helpdesk (pdf)](overview.png)](intro.pdf)

We're launching a weekly Programming helpdesk for Physics students; it will take place on **Tuesdays 11:30am–1:30pm in LB203** (Physics labs). All levels (100 to 400) are welcome – we're hoping you'll take the opportunity to help each other in groups, but we'll also have some academics and grad students come along to help.

To get the ball rolling for the first session (Tuesday 7th March), there will be pizza and soft drinks at 12:15 pm. 

Once a month, we'll also organise a 20–30 minutes "teaser" presentation on some programming topics that you may wish to explore further*.
